# TODO: static ai: in AvailiablePath: make better awareness with listOfBommbs

# TODO: static ai: check AvailiablePath for execution time (make avariables global?)

# TODO: in static ai: check the bombs listing coords function

# TODO: make/find a better model, input it, train it and test it

## ======================================

# DONE: Initial commit

# DONE: make a collecting data script

# DONE: make a training script (with Keras)

# DONE: try a training

# DONE: train a model

# DONE: test a model

# DONE: fixed and make equal inputs for each keys (might be hard for the shift key) 
(make a balancing data script)
(mixed all keys throughout the dataset)

# DONE: make a dataset for tensorflow(-gpu) -> for keras

# DONE: make a script which use the NN for playing

# DONE: make a specific config (for the game) to only use (e,s,d,f and ctrl)
 to get more balanced data after capture

# DONE: in static ai: switch all the script to [y,x] convention, because potentialPath.shape: (15, 20)
It will help debugging on the long run.

# DONE: static ai: make AvailiablePath blast aware
